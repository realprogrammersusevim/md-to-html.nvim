## TODO

- [X] Clean up unneeded Lua converter code
- [X] Add command options such as converting in place
- [ ] Add configuration options to change default behaviour
  - [ ] Open file in browser once converted
- [X] Write some great documentation so users can learn about my plugin with `:help`
- [ ] Write some tests (because apparently those are important)
