# Credits 

Huge thank you to the OG Markdown.pl script at [daringfireball.net](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). That was the first script I found to actually convert markdown into a simple HTML document.

But the biggest thanks goes to [Peter Melnichenko](https://github.com/mpeterv) and  [Niklas Frykholm](https://github.com/niklasfrykholm) for converting that Perl script into pure Lua. I'm so glad they already did that because I am:

1. Not comfortable in regular expressions and 
2. Do not know Perl.

Lua also apparently has a very simple regex engine which makes the conversion from Perl's advanced and flexible regex difficult. Again, I cannot thank these two developers enough.

I would like to thank Steve Losh's _Learning Vimscript the Hard Way_ for convincing me to use Lua. Which after I found the Lua port of the Perl script turned out to be a great decision.
